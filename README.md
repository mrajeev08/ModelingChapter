# Modeling canine rabies virus transmission dynamics 
Chapter 20 in forthcoming [Rabies, 4th edition](https://www.elsevier.com/books/rabies/fooks/978-0-12-818705-0). 

## Abstract
Mathematical models of infectious disease are used to develop an understanding of disease dynamics and aid in the design of control strategies. Specifically, modeling can guide planning and implementation of interventions and improve our understanding of how disease dynamics, and therefore intervention strategies, may change as control measures are implemented. In light of the mounting evidence that elimination of canine rabies is a realistic objective, the WHO has set a global target of zero human deaths due to dog-mediated rabies by 2030. In this chapter, we focus on how dynamic epidemiological modeling can contribute to guiding efforts to achieve this goal. We review existing modeling work and the insights generated from these studies, and identify outstanding questions and gaps in our knowledge. We further discuss the role that modeling can play in the future to address these questions and inform elimination.

All code used to generate figures in the main text are included in the rmarkdown doc [figures_code.rmd](figures_code.Rmd) and can be viewed along with outputs in the [html output](figures_code.html).

In addition, the following supplemental files referred to in the text are included here and in the html output:
- [Table S1](Table.S1.xlsx): excel file with summary of all modeling studies included in the
literature review.
- [Figure S1](figs/figS1.jpeg): density vs. frequency dependent transmission models
- [Figure S2](figs/figS2.jpeg): types of modeling studies reviewed

Final outputs are in [figs/](figs). Data pulled from modeling studies and used to make figures are included in  [data/](data). In addition, the raw Scopus and Pubmed results used for the literature review and shapefile of Tanzania Roads from [the World Bank](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/tanzania-roads) used in Figure 1E are also included in this folder.
